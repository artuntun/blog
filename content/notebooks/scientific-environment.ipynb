    "The most common question for someone first picking up Python is \"which Python?\".\n",
    "The fundamental Python experience will be the same whichever you use (or if you just use the built-in system Python - although this is not recommended).\n",
    "The difference lies in the ease of installation, the default bundled packages, and some added bonus features.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Anaconda**  [(link)](https://www.continuum.io/downloads)\n",
    "\n",
    "Anaconda is the go-to distribution for Python.\n",
    "It's the most popular distribution for data science and it's also free and open-source.\n",
    "\n",
    "Among the many useful features:\n",
    "* Simple downloader/installer.\n",
    "* The ability to create and move between different environments to work in (see below).\n",
    "* The standard distribution comes with a comprehensive scientific stack - everything from numerics to image processing.\n",
    "* Manages non-Python packages - some Python libraries utilise libraries from C/FORTRAN which can be difficult to install, however not with Anaconda.\n",
    "* Almost identical experience across Windows/Linux.\n",
    "* As of recently, the [Intel MKL Optimisations](https://docs.continuum.io/mkl-optimizations/) come as standard in the distribution.\n",
    "What this means is that numerical computations in `numpy` or `scipy` will automatically be parallelised to use all available CPU power where possible - without having to change a line of code!\n",
    "\n",
    "To download, simply visit the link above and follow the instructions.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Enthought Canopy**  [(link)](https://www.enthought.com/products/canopy/)\n",
    "\n",
    "Canopy is the second largest distribution, and has a more 'MATLAB' feel to it. \n",
    "There is a graphical package manager so managing packages is a doddle.\n",
    "Addition features and add-ons are available through subscriptions and purchases, similar to MATLAB's toolboxes.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **WinPython (Windows)** [(link)](https://winpython.github.io/)\n",
    "\n",
    "WinPython is a purely Windows installation of Python. Before Anaconda it was probably the most stable way of interfacing Python packages with C/FORTRAN on Windows. With Anaconda it has lost that edge to some extent but is still recommended if you plan to use the high performance computing package, [theano](http://deeplearning.net/software/theano/install.html)."

    "Finally there are two recent developments worth mentioning.\n",
    "The first is [Anaconda Cloud](https://docs.continuum.io/anaconda-cloud/), a cloud-based solution for all things Anaconda.\n",
    "Here you can upload environments, files, packages, and notebooks to ensure consistency across different machines and to allow for collaboration. \n",
    "At the moment I feel like it is a little clunky and superfluous to keeping an `environment.yml` file, but only time will tell.\n",
    "\n",
    "Secondly, a number of IDEs now support Conda environments and offer interfaces for using and maintaining environments.\n",
    "If you are a big Jupyter notebook user then the [nb_conda](https://github.com/Anaconda-Platform/nb_conda) extension integrates Conda environments into the notebook.\n",

    "#### **Docker** [(link)](https://www.docker.com/)\n",
    "\n",
    "Docker is the extreme of code and environment isolation, being more of a virtual machine than a virtual environment.\n",
    "Unless you are having system compatibility issues (Windows v. Linux, e.t.c.) or planning to host an application online then chances are you will never need to use Docker.\n",
    "It is however a very interesting a powerful tool for ensuring consistency and reproducibility.\n",
    "\n",
    "Docker is distinguished from a virtual machine shown in the schematic below.\n",
    "Applications and programs are contained in 'containers' which are isolated from each other and speak only to the Docker Engine.\n",
    "Containers can be linked to communicate between each other and share data.\n",
    "For example, one might have a container carrying out analysis on a dataset and another container hosting a website to display the outcomes.\n",

    "Using multiple containers requires a `Docker-Compose` file which describes how the containers interact and which ports are accessible.\n",
    "\n",
    "But what use is this for a scientist? \n",
    "For one, if you are required to use software not available on your machine then Docker gives a lightweight means of running it.\n",
    "However the main draw is that in theory, equipped with a DockerFile, code, and data, anyone would be able to reproduce the same results of your study regardless of their machine and setup (provided they can run Docker).\n",

    "It is functional, well maintained, and offers space to code, debug, and run as many Python/IPython terminals as you may require.\n",

    "The Jupyter Notebook (previously know as the IPython Notebook) has revolutionised how exploratory data analysis is carried out.\n",
    "The notebook runs in a web browser and can incorporate images, videos, tex, and raw HTML.\n",
    "Code is run in 'cells' which can be run independently and repeatably, avoiding the need to run an entire script every time.\n",
    "This quick work-flow combined with the inclusion of inline graphs and text has made the Jupyter Notebook the go-to vessel for story telling and interactive write ups. In fact, a number of books and tutorials have been written purely in [notebook format](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/), and even this blog is written in a notebook!\n",
    "\n",
    "Other features include:\n",
    "* Ability to create slideshows/presentations out of the box.\n",
    "* Jupyter Notebook servers - run the computation on one machine which can be accessed from any number of others - even if they don't have Python installed.\n",

    "This makes a text editor ideal for small scripts or corrections to big scripts.\n",

If so, let me know what you think is better and more importantly *why* in the comments below. I'm always on the lookout for ways to make my day-to-day workflow easier!\n",

For academic reproducibility we're probably even further off a solution given how little incentive there is currently to publish code and open it up to scrutiny."
